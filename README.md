PRODIGY INFOTECH DATASCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK-01

Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

DATASEt:

The dataset used for this task is https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

Jupyter notebook

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib for visualization

EXPLOITARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

Visualization: Created a bar chart, Pie chart, Graphs to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

CONCLUSION:

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
